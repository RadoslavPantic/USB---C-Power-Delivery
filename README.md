## Description

The project is based around the STUSB4710 Autonomous USB PD controller IC. The design functions as a power source with short-circuit protection and Vbus monitoring.
The project is configured in a buck topology, meaning there is a constant 24 V DC voltage at the input of the circuit. Using the TPS56837HRPAR buck converter, the PD IC sets the output USB-C compliant voltage. The project is hardware-heavy â€” the MCU is only needed to monitor the buck converter and to increase the current on the 20 V PDO from 2.25 A to 5 A
